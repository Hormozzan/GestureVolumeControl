# Gesture Volume Control
Use hand gestures to control the system's volume. Based on the distance between your thumb and index finger, you can simply control your system's volume. The more the distance, the more the volume.

## Usage
To install the requirements, copy this line to your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, use `VolumeHandGesture.py` to lower and raise the volume:
```
python VolumeHandGesture.py
```
Alternatively, you can use `GVC.py` to run the script in the background. It does not output the webCam image:
```
python GVC.py
```
