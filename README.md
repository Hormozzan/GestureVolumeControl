# Gesture Volume Control
Use hand gestures to control the system volume. Based on the distance between your thumb and index finger, you can simply control your system's volume.

## Usage
First, install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, use `VolumeHandGesture.py` to lower and raise the volume:
```
python VolumeHandGesture.py
```
Alternatively, you can use `GVC.py` to run the script in background. It does not output the webCam image:
```
python GVC.py
```
