## Gesture Volume Control
Use hand gesture to control system volume. Based on the distance between your thumb and index finger, you can simply control your system's volume.

# Usage
First, install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, use `VolumeHandGesture.py` to lower and raise the volume:
```
python VolumeHandGesture.py
```
